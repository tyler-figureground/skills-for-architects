name: code-analysis
description: Generate a STANDARD CODE ANALYSIS cover-sheet for a building project. Activate when the user types /code-analysis, or asks to "run a code analysis", "produce a code summary / code review sheet", "build the code cover sheet", or wants occupant load + egress + allowable height/area assembled into one cited document for a project. Reads the project's PROJECT.md, runs deterministic norma calculators, quotes governing corpus sections, writes Markdown into the project's code dir, and offers a Google Docs export.

> **Norma engine.** This skill calls the `norma` CLI (an editable install of the Norma engine — calculators + corpus are live). If `norma` isn't on PATH, put the Python Scripts dir on PATH or use `python "$NORMA_HOME/tools/norma_cli.py" <verb>`. Universal context — persona, source types, corpus routing, known divergences — is in the plugin's [`agents.md`](../../agents.md).
>
> **Hard rules:** ground every answer in the corpus (`norma search` / `norma grep`), never memory; quote the controlling text verbatim and cite `<edition> § <number>`; numbers come from `norma codecalc`, never by hand; run `norma guard -j <j>` on every draft; abstain over guessing. You answer the architect of record **as a peer** — never "consult a professional," and do not emit the marketplace disclaimer marker.

# Standard Code Analysis Generator

Assembles a single cited cover-sheet document from the deterministic calculators and the local code corpus - the thing that goes on the first sheet of a permit set.

This is the *generator* sibling of `/ibc`. `/ibc` answers one question; `/code-analysis` runs the whole battery for one project and writes a document.

## Document-specific rules

- **State the governing edition + jurisdiction up front and on every line.** Every value-bearing line cites `<edition> <section>`, e.g. `2022 NYC Building Code Table 1004.1.3`. A line with a number and no citation is a bug.
- **Flag every table-derived number** with a trailing ` — verify against published code`.
- **Run `norma guard` on the finished draft before presenting.** If any citation comes back UNVERIFIED, the document is not done - locate the real section in the corpus and fix it, then re-run until it passes.

## Inputs: the project profile

```bash
norma project active        # active project (from the workspace PROJECT.md front-matter)
norma project show          # full field set (jurisdiction, occupancy, construction, sprinklered, …)
```

`norma project show` prints the fields the analysis needs: `jurisdiction` (nyc|california|other), `_corpus` (e.g. `nyc/2022`), `occupancy_group`, `construction_type`, `sprinklered`, `stories`, `building_area_sf`, `frontage_ft`, plus `existing_co_occupant_load`, `existing_exits`, `place_of_assembly_strategy`, `tenancy`, `notes`. **Confirm scope** before adopting it: `norma project scope-check "<project name or address>"` - a `WARNING` means the active project doesn't match the building you were asked about.

### If fields are missing - interview, don't assume

If there is no active project, or required fields are blank, ask the architect directly in one batched message. Minimum set to run a full analysis:

- **Jurisdiction / location** (sets the governing edition)
- **Occupancy group(s)** - e.g. `B`, `A-2`; note mixed/separated vs. non-separated
- **Construction type** - e.g. `I-B`, `II-A`, `V-B`
- **Sprinklered?** - boolean or system (`NFPA 13` / `13R` / `13D` / none)
- **Stories** above grade plane and **building/fit-out area (sf)**
- **Frontage (ft)** and open-space details if a Chapter 5 frontage increase is claimed
- **Per-space breakdown** (function of space + area sf) for the occupant-load table

Offer to capture the answers via **`/project-dossier`** - it writes the `PROJECT.md` front-matter that `norma project active` reads, so the next run auto-scopes.

### If the input is a drawing or PDF

When the project arrives as a PDF/drawing rather than a profile, ingest it first with `norma drawing` (full workflow in the drawing-analysis skill): `norma drawing info` triages each page (vector vs scanned), `sheets` rosters them, `text --region br` pulls the title block (address → jurisdiction, scale), and `render --for-vision` yields legible tiles. Feed extracted space areas into `occupant-load` - do not retype numbers the tool already extracted.

When the architect has the **CAD/BIM source** (DWG/DXF/IFC) rather than only a plot, prefer `norma ingest <file>` - it returns one structured `extract` (IFC: `spaces[].area` + `doors[].width` semantically; DXF/DWG: exact `geometry`). Feed `spaces[].area` into `occupant-load` and `geometry` into `plancheck` with no eyeballing. Fidelity order: IFC > DXF/DWG > vector-PDF > vision.

## Calculators

```bash
norma codecalc occupant-load --function "Business areas" --area 18500 -j nyc --json
norma codecalc min-exits     --load 185 --occupancy B                 -j nyc --json
norma codecalc egress-width  --load 185 --component stairways --sprinklered -j nyc --json
norma codecalc egress-width  --load 185 --component other     --sprinklered -j nyc --json
norma codecalc travel        --occupancy B --sprinklered               -j nyc --json
norma codecalc allowable     --occupancy B --construction I-B --sprinklered -j nyc --json
```

Rules:
- Use the returned `section`/`sections` verbatim as the citation.
- If a result has `"error"`, print the message and `options` to the architect and ask which to use.
- If a result has `"verify"`, carry that text into the sheet as a `verify` note on that line.
- For `min-exits` above the first story, pass `--story N` (1 = first story above grade plane). The single-exit allowance is first-story-only; without `--story` the result carries a `verify` caveat and may understate exits on an upper floor. E.g. `norma codecalc min-exits --load 36 --occupancy B --story 5 -j nyc` → 2 exits.

## Pulling governing sections from the corpus

For each computed value, open the corpus and quote the controlling section so the sheet is self-supporting:

```bash
norma grep "1016\.2\.1" -j nyc
norma grep -i "occupant load factor|travel distance|allowable area" -j nyc
```

For any cover-sheet item whose section you don't already know (fire-resistance ratings, special inspections, accessibility scoping), run concept search first, then quote the hit:

```bash
norma search "fire-resistance rating exterior bearing wall" -j nyc
norma search "accessible route entrance"                    -j ca
```

Read the matched chapter file around the hit (include exceptions). Resolve cross-references before citing.

## Output document

Write Markdown into the project's code dir. Get the destination with **`norma project analysis-dir`** (it prints/creates `<workspace>/06 Research & Existing Conditions/Code/`), then write **`06 …/Code/<project>-code-analysis.md`**. Use exactly these sections, every value-line ending in a `<edition> <section>` citation:

1. **Project & Jurisdiction** - name, address, jurisdiction, governing edition (one line explicitly), corpus path.
2. **Occupancy Classification** - group(s), mixed-use treatment (separated/non-separated), cite Chapter 3 sections.
3. **Construction Type** - Chapter 6 type, cite Table 601 element ratings as relevant.
4. **Allowable vs. Actual** - table: Height (ft), Stories, Area (sf) with allowable (from `allowable`, incl. frontage increase if claimed) vs. actual (from the profile), pass/fail per row. Cite Chapter 5 (Tables 503/504/506 per edition) + the section returned by the calculator.
5. **Occupant Load** - per-space table: Function | Area (sf) | Factor | Basis | OL | Section; total. Cite the occupant-load-factor table (`Table 1004.x`).
6. **Means of Egress** - exits required vs. provided; required egress width (stairways + other); max travel distance; common-path-of-travel limit. Each line cited.
7. **Fire-Resistance Ratings** - structural elements, separations, shaft/corridor ratings; cite Table 601 / Chapter 7 sections.
8. **Accessibility scope** - applicable chapter: IBC/NYC Ch. 11; **California splits 11A (housing) vs 11B (public/commercial)** - pick the right one and say which. Cite the governing section.
9. **Code References** - consolidated list of every `<edition> <section>` cited above, deduped.

Formatting conventions:
- Header line: `Governing code: <edition> (<jurisdiction>). All citations are to this edition unless noted.`
- Every table-derived line: trailing ` — verify against published code`.
- Where a calculator returned `verify`, append `verify: <text>`.
- No em dashes; use a spaced hyphen.

## Citation guard (mandatory final gate)

```bash
norma guard -j nyc --text "$(cat "$(norma project analysis-dir)/<project>-code-analysis.md")"
```

Exit `0` = all citations traceable. Exit `1` = UNVERIFIED citations present - **do not present**; find the real section and fix, then re-run. Report the guard result (verified/total) to the architect as evidence the sheet is clean.

## Export to Google Docs (offer after the sheet passes)

After the Markdown is written and the guard passes, offer to export via the **google-workspace** MCP. Do NOT call MCP during skill setup - only if the architect says yes.

Steps at use-time:
1. `ToolSearch` with `select:mcp__google-workspace__import_to_google_doc` to load its schema.
2. Prefer **`import_to_google_doc`** - imports the Markdown file directly, preserving heading/table structure. Pass the absolute path and a doc title like `Code Analysis - <Project> (<edition>)`.
3. Fallback **`create_doc`** + `batch_update_doc` / `insert_doc_elements` only if `import_to_google_doc` is unavailable.
4. If the MCP returns an auth/consent error, tell the architect the exact tool and that it needs Google authorization (`start_google_auth`), and stop.

The local Markdown in `06 …/Code/` is the source of truth; the Doc is a convenience copy.

## Worked example

`/code-analysis` with an active project (NYC, Group B, Type I-B, NFPA 13, 22 stories, 18500 sf fit-out, 200 ft frontage):

```bash
norma project active
# FiDi Office Fit-Out  [2022 NYC Building Code]

norma codecalc occupant-load --function "Business areas" --area 18500 -j nyc --json
# -> occupants 185, factor 100 gross, section "Table 1004.1.3"

norma codecalc min-exits --load 185 --occupancy B -j nyc --json
norma codecalc egress-width --load 185 --component stairways --sprinklered -j nyc --json
norma codecalc egress-width --load 185 --component other --sprinklered -j nyc --json
norma codecalc travel --occupancy B --sprinklered -j nyc --json
norma codecalc allowable --occupancy B --construction I-B --sprinklered -j nyc --json

norma grep -i "business areas|occupant load factor" -j nyc
norma grep "1016\.2\.1|common path" -j nyc

# Assemble 06 …/Code/fidi-office-fit-out-code-analysis.md (9 sections, every line cited)

norma guard -j nyc --text "$(cat "$(norma project analysis-dir)/fidi-office-fit-out-code-analysis.md")"
# -> expect "PASS: all citations traceable to corpus."
```

Present to the architect: the path to the written sheet, the guard result (e.g. `12 verified, 0 unverified`), and the export offer.
