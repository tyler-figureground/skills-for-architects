```

The skill researches two sections:

1. **Climate** — monthly temperature normals, precipitation, prevailing winds, sun angles, ASHRAE/Köppen classification, humidity, design temperatures
2. **Natural Features & Hazards** — topography, FEMA flood zones, seismic risk, soil conditions, vegetation, water bodies, contamination

Output is saved to `~/Documents/environmental-analysis-[location-slug].md`.

## Data Sources

Only governmental, university, and non-profit sources are used:
