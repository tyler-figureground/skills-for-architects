name: project-dossier
description: Create or update the project dossier — a PROJECT.md file in the working directory holding persistent project facts (identity, site, zoning, program, code edition) plus an index of decisions. Use when starting a project, when the user says "set up the project" or "remember this for the project", or when an analysis skill needs somewhere to record findings. Facts only — to record a decision with its rationale, use /decision.

# /project-dossier — Project Facts File

You maintain `PROJECT.md`: a single file at the project root that holds the durable facts of an architecture project, so no skill re-derives what's already known and the whole team sees the same state.

The dossier is the **facts layer**. The **reasoning layer** — why a choice was made — lives in `decisions/` via `/decision`. Don't mix them: PROJECT.md says *what is*; a decision record says *why it is*.

`PROJECT.md` has two parts that must agree: a **YAML front-matter machine contract** at the very top (tools read this) and **human-readable tables** below (people read these). The front-matter is the shared header every architect skill keys off — most importantly Norma, which scopes code answers from `jurisdiction`, `occupancy_group`, `construction_type`, and `sprinklered`. Your job includes keeping the two in sync.

## Usage

```
/project-dossier            → show current dossier status (or offer to init)
/project-dossier init       → create PROJECT.md, interview for the basics
/project-dossier update     → reconcile the dossier with new facts from the conversation
```

## Hard rules

1. **Every entry carries a source and a date.** `FAR 6.02 (PLUTO, 2026-06-10)` — never an orphan number. If the user states a fact verbally, the source is `client, YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. **Update in place, never duplicate.** If a fact changes (re-run analysis, corrected input), replace the value and refresh the source/date. The dossier holds current state, not history — history is git's job.
3. **Facts only.** "Zoning district: R7A" belongs here. "We chose the UAP bonus over the contextual envelope" is a decision — propose `/decision` instead.
4. **Project facts only.** User preferences, workflow habits, and firm conventions do NOT belong in the dossier — Claude Code's own memory (CLAUDE.md, auto memory) handles those.
5. **Front-matter and tables stay in sync.** Every code/identity fact you write to a human table also updates the matching front-matter key, and vice-versa — they are one fact in two places. The front-matter holds the bare current value (no source/date — YAML keys can't); the table row carries that value plus its Source + Date. If they ever disagree, the table (with its provenance) is the source of truth — reconcile the front-matter to it.

## The machine contract (front-matter)

The YAML block at the top of `PROJECT.md` is the contract every architect skill reads. Use exactly these keys — tools look them up by name:

| Key | Type / values | Mirrors (human table) | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `project` | free text | Identity → Project | display name; `name` is an accepted alias |
| `address` | free text | Identity → Address / BBL | |
| `jurisdiction` | `nyc` \| `california` \| `other` | Identity → Jurisdiction | **drives Norma's corpus + edition** |
| `edition` | string | Code → Building code edition | blank → derived from `jurisdiction` |
| `occupancy_group` | `B`, `"A-2"`, or list `[B, "S-1"]` | Code → Occupancy group | IBC use group(s) |
| `construction_type` | `I-A`, `II-B`, `V-B`, … | Code → Construction type | IBC Ch.6 |
| `sprinklered` | `true` \| `false` \| `"NFPA 13"` … | Code → Sprinklered | bool or system string |
| `stories` | integer | Code → Stories | above grade plane |
| `building_area_sf` | number | Code → Building area (SF) | whole-building vs fit-out → note in table |
| `frontage_ft` | number | Code → Frontage (ft) | Ch.5 area-increase input |
| `existing_co_occupant_load` | number | Code → Existing C-of-O occupant load | from the existing Certificate of Occupancy |
| `existing_exits` | integer | Code → Existing exits | exits serving the space today |
| `place_of_assembly_strategy` | free text | Code → Place-of-assembly strategy | e.g. "stay under 75 occ" |
| `tenancy` | `single` \| `multi` | Code → Tenancy | tenant configuration |

Rules for the block:
- **Blank means unknown, not a default.** Norma ignores blank fields and falls back to its own examples; it never assumes a value you didn't write. (So don't pre-fill `jurisdiction: other` on a project you haven't scoped — leave it blank.)
- `jurisdiction` is canonical — write `nyc`, `california`, or `other`. Free-form forms ("New York City", "ca") are tolerated but normalize to those three.
- This block carries **values only** — no source/date. Provenance lives in the matching table row.

**Round-trip check:** from a folder holding a filled `PROJECT.md`, `norma project active` returns that project's jurisdiction / occupancy / construction / sprinklered. That is the contract working.

## On `init`

1. If `PROJECT.md` already exists, say so and switch to `update` mode.
2. Ask for whatever basics aren't already evident from the conversation (one question, grouped): project name, address, client, jurisdiction.
3. Write `PROJECT.md` from the template below, filling what you know, leaving the rest blank. **Write the front-matter and the human tables together** — every fact you fill goes in both the machine contract (top) and its mirror row, with source + date on the table side.
4. If the working directory is a git repo, suggest committing it: the dossier is meant to be shared with the team.

## On `update`

1. Read `PROJECT.md` — both the front-matter and the tables.
2. Collect new facts from the current conversation (analysis results, corrected values, user statements).
3. Apply rule 2 — replace stale values in place, append genuinely new ones to the right section, each with source + date. When a fact maps to a front-matter key, **update the key and its mirror row in the same pass** (rule 5). If the file has no front-matter yet (an older dossier), add the block from the template while you're there.
4. Show a short diff-style summary of what changed.

# Project Dossier — {project name}

> Maintained by Architecture Studio skills and the project team.
> Every entry carries a source and a date. Facts only — rationale lives in the decisions/ directory.
> The YAML front-matter above is the machine mirror of the Identity + Code tables — keep them in agreement.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Project | |
| Address / BBL | |
| Client | |
| Jurisdiction | |

## Site

<!-- site-planner skills append here: climate, flood, transit, demographics, context -->

## Zoning

<!-- zoning skills append here: district, FAR, envelope results, overlays, landmark status -->

## Program

<!-- programming skills append here: headcount, space program, occupant loads -->

## Code

<!-- Mirrors the machine contract in the front-matter. Change a value here → change it there too. -->

| Item | Value | Source | Date |
|------|-------|--------|------|
| Building code edition | | | |
| Occupancy group | | | |
| Construction type | | | |
| Sprinklered | | | |
| Stories | | | |
| Building area (SF) | | | |
| Frontage (ft) | | | |
| Existing C-of-O occupant load | | | |
| Existing exits | | | |
| Place-of-assembly strategy | | | |
| Tenancy | | | |

## Decisions

<!-- maintained by /decision — do not edit by hand -->

| # | Decision | Status | Date |
|---|----------|--------|------|
```

## How other skills use the dossier

Analysis skills in this marketplace check for `PROJECT.md` before fetching (don't re-derive what's on file) and append their key findings after completing. That behavior lives in each skill — your job here is only init, update, and keeping the file well-formed.

**Norma reads the front-matter, not the tables.** The `10-norma` code skills (`/ibc`, `/egress`, `/code-analysis`, …) call `norma project active`, which parses the YAML front-matter into the active project profile and auto-scopes every code answer to it. That is the whole reason the machine contract exists and the whole reason it must stay in sync — a stale front-matter key silently scopes a code analysis to the wrong jurisdiction or occupancy. When a Norma analysis hands back a corrected fact (e.g. it determined the construction type), fold it back in via `update` so the contract and the cited sheet agree.

## Edge cases

| Situation | Handling |
|-----------|----------|
| `PROJECT.md` exists but malformed / hand-edited | Preserve all content; reorganize into template sections; say what moved |
| `PROJECT.md` predates the front-matter (no YAML block) | Add the machine-contract block from the template, populated from the existing tables; don't disturb the prose |
| Front-matter and a table disagree | The table (sourced + dated) wins — reconcile the front-matter to it; note the fix |
| Facts conflict (dossier says X, user says Y) | Ask once; the answer wins; update with new source + date |
| No project context at all, user just ran `/project-dossier` | Show usage and ask if they want `init` |
| Multiple projects in one directory | One dossier per directory — suggest separate working directories |
