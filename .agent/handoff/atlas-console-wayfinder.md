# Atlas console redesign - wayfinder continuity

Status: layout and write contract settled; nothing is blocked; the tree is what remains
Date: 2026-09-03
Effort: `atlas-console`

## Where the work lives

The map is the canonical artifact, not this file.

- Map: `.scratch/atlas-console/map.md`
- Tickets: `.scratch/atlas-console/issues/NN-*.md`
- Tracker convention: local Markdown (`~/.claude/skills-archive-2026-07-21/setup-matt-pocock-skills/issue-tracker-local.md`), because no issue tracker was provisioned for this repo.

## Destination

A shipped, installed Atlas carrying the SOLID+VOID identity, a navigable per-project
folder tree with not-on-disk awareness, the dossier readable in-app, drive-wide
search, and file-level actions - every write still crossing an `atlas.core` plan with
preview and confirmation.

This map carries execution, not only decisions. That is a deliberate override of
Wayfinder's plan-don't-do default and is recorded in the map's Notes.

## Settled at charting

- Destination: a working app, not a spec.
- Tree model: filesystem mirror, with a separate not-on-disk list rather than ghost
  nodes merged inline.
- Operator: the principal daily and studio staff occasionally - both served, via
  progressive disclosure.
- In scope: dossier in-app, global search, file-level actions.
- Out of scope: portfolio dashboard.

## Session 1 output

- Rendered the current TUI headless for a baseline.
- Built three visual worlds as real Textual renders at 132x38 - POCHE, TITLE BLOCK,
  PAPER - and published them for comparison:
  https://claude.ai/code/artifact/4a9756ec-d166-44d0-b76d-ddd9979fbbc6
  Prototype source is throwaway and lives only in the session scratchpad. It is not
  Atlas code and must not become Atlas code.
- Charted the map with ten tickets and the fog.
- Dispatched research tickets 05 and 06 to parallel `/research` subagents. Both were
  instructed to write under `docs/research/`, create no branch, commit nothing, and
  never touch a production or shared drive.

## Session 2

- Landed the whole working tree on the user's instruction. Tests (201) and lint
  green before committing. `main` ahead of `origin/main`, not pushed.
- Visual world locked: **A - POCHE**. The user then reopened the wordmark itself,
  asking for retro-cyberpunk 3D extruded gradient lettering. Five treatments built
  and published on the same artifact; ticket 02 stays claimed on three questions.
- Both research tickets resolved and indexed. Six tickets graduated from what they
  surfaced: 11, 12, 13 from the Drive cost research; 14, 15, 16 from the Textual
  research.

## Session 3

Ticket 02 resolved: POCHE world, EMBER wordmark, half-block rendering. Header
went from 9 rows to 6 with a finer gradient, not a coarser one. Three-step
collapse rule by terminal width. Retro register stops at the wordmark and the
cursor. Tickets 17 (header as Atlas code) and 18 (token layer) graduated.

## Session 4

- Ticket 12 resolved by measurement. The user authorised reading the studio drive,
  read-only, nothing created. **The whole drive is 7,956 folders and 18,536 files
  and walks in 4.24 seconds.** Throughput is a non-issue at this size; the cost is
  all in the tail, cold p99 91 ms and worst 314 ms.
- That walk found **two live MAX_PATH failures**, one of which Atlas reports as an
  empty folder that contains an entry. Ticket 16 confirmed on production data;
  ticket 19 opened for the extended-length prefix decision. `find_empty_dirs` is
  verified not at risk - `os.walk` omits the failing directory, so neither it nor
  its parent is ever marked empty. False reporting, not destruction.
- Ticket 14 resolved. Two orthogonal axes - Filing State and Load State - rather
  than one flat enum. Unmet map Expectations are not nodes. Terms in `CONTEXT.md`,
  decision in `docs/adr/0004`.

## Known contradiction to fix

The published prototype renders draw missing folders **inline** in the tree as dim
hatched rows *and* list them under NOT ON DISK. That is the same fact twice and it
violates the filesystem-mirror model chosen at charting. Ticket 14 rules the inline
rows out. Whoever builds the renderer drops them; the NOT ON DISK list stays. The
sheet has not been re-rendered to match.

## Session 5 - first code

Tickets 16 and 19 built, not just decided. `list_entries` returns a `Listing`
carrying Load State; `long_path()` applies the `\?\` prefix on demand at the
three read chokepoints. 211 tests pass, up from 201. Both live over-MAX_PATH
folders verified fixed on the real drive; the one holding an item no longer
reports as empty.

Writes were deliberately left alone - a move can push a path past the limit, and
Atlas must not create paths Explorer and Revit cannot open. That check is in the
fog, owned by the conform work.

## Session 6 - the header is real

Tickets 13, 17 and 18 done. 261 tests pass, up from 211 at the start of the day.

- **Token layer** (`tui/tokens.py`). Python owns the palette and glyph table and
  generates the Textual CSS; `MODAL_CSS` and `STATUS_STYLES` migrated. Colour is
  tested by contrast and structure, never hex. That test failed on four of the
  prototype's tokens and they were lightened until it passed. It also flips ACTION
  to vermilion and REVIEW to ochre from the old yellow/red.
- **Wordmark** (`tui/wordmark.py`). Half-block compositor, extrusion, ramp sampler
  and three compositions, replacing Textual's `Header`. 111 / 78 / 20 columns and
  4 / 4 / 1 rows.
- **Counts.** Immediate children only, and only on a folder Atlas has actually
  read. Recursive counts are out - incompatible with lazy loading regardless of
  cost.

Two corrections worth carrying forward, both caught by building rather than
designing:

- The published width rule (115 / 82) is the mark widths (111 / 78) **plus the
  console's four columns of padding**. A naive "widest that fits" renders the mark
  flush against both edges. `MARGIN` is now a named constant.
- `ops.find_empty_dirs` removes folders with no file *anywhere beneath*, while the
  tree calls a folder empty when it has no children *of its own*. Two predicates,
  one word, and one of them deletes. Now named **Fileless** and **Empty Folder** in
  `CONTEXT.md`.

## Session 7 - the console has a shape

Ticket 03 resolved. No code this session: 03 is a grilling ticket and Wayfinder
allows one ticket per session. 261 tests still pass, lint green, nothing in
`tools/atlas` changed.

**The session's real find was a measurement, not a decision.** The effort had been
designing against 132x38 with 80x24 as the floor. Both were assumed and both are
wrong. Herdr - the agent runtime now in daily use - logs every PTY resize to
`~/AppData/Roaming/herdr/herdr-server.log`. Forty events on this machine:

- Columns: 46 (9), 77 (8), 153 (7), 179 (3), 87/88 (3), 120 (2), then 80, 57, 48, 39.
- Rows: 51 in 33 of 40 events, 52 in 3, then 40, 30, 24 once each.

Rows are abundant and near-constant. Columns are scarce and trimodal. **Eight of
the twelve distinct widths cannot hold two columns of content**, so the narrow
arrangement is the common case, not the fallback. The map's verification-sizes
constraint has been rewritten to the measured widths.

The decision that follows from it: three **Regions** - Project List, Tree Region,
Companion Region - in two **Compositions**. The Companion sits *under* the Tree,
not beside it, spending rows to save columns. Split Composition at >= 100 columns,
Single-Region below, refusal under 40 columns or 16 rows. Navigation is identical
in both. Explicit collapse outranks the breakpoint default. The Workspace follows
the list cursor, debounced 150 ms with cache hits exempt, so the tree is populated
at first paint rather than on a keystroke.

Two things get absorbed rather than added: `#detail` and `action_inspect`'s health
modal both become Companion Modes. That reclaims Enter, which the tree needs.

Recorded in `docs/adr/0005`, vocabulary in `CONTEXT.md` under Atlas Console
Layout. Ticket 20 graduated - the console shell as Atlas code, the frame without
the tree in it.

## Session 7 continued - the write contract

Ticket 04 resolved in the same session as 03, on the user's instruction to
proceed. Wayfinder's one-ticket-per-session rule was set aside deliberately, not
forgotten; context budget was the reason for it and there was budget.

Reading the write path first changed the ticket. Two findings the ticket's own
framing had wrong:

- **The staleness guard is a full `scan_drive`.** `action_conform` rescans the
  entire drive on confirm - 4.24 seconds per ticket 12 - and refuses to write
  unless the map, the rebuilt plan, and `_project_token` all match the preview.
  Correct once for a deliberate conform. Fatal per keystroke on a node.
- **`_project_token` only covers the project root** (`app.py:73`, the sorted
  `(name, is_dir)` list of `root_entries`). A node three levels down was never
  covered by the guard the ticket assumed protected it.

The decision, in one line: **the tree invents no new action kinds.** Drifted,
Misplaced and Loose are exactly RENAME, RELOCATE and SWEEP; an unmet Expectation
is BACKFILL and belongs to the Companion because ADR 0004 says it is not a node.
Core gains a way to build a one-Action Plan, nothing more.

Everything else follows from that plus the user's two overrides - full undo stack
rather than the one-level version recommended, and warn rather than refuse on
MAX_PATH:

- Confirmation weight follows plan size. One action confirms inline on the
  operation line; longer plans keep the modal.
- Full undo stack, **one per Project**, in memory, no redo. Undo restores the
  precondition that offered the action, so re-pressing the repair key is redo.
- `Action.moved`, a manifest of what each apply actually moved. A merge cannot be
  inverted without it, and inverting by inference is data loss.
- Revalidation scopes to the action. Same guard runs on undo pops, which is what
  lets the stack be optimistic rather than eagerly invalidated.
- Path length warns in `build_plan`, and **`long_path()` is never applied on the
  write side** - the warning is only honest if Atlas cannot silently exceed 260.

Recorded in `docs/adr/0006`, vocabulary in `CONTEXT.md` under Atlas Writes. Ticket
21 graduated - the core write surface, buildable and testable without a TUI. The
write-side MAX_PATH fog patch is cleared; what is left of it is a narrower `doctor`
question, still deferred.

## Frontier

**As of session 10:** unblocked and unclaimed are **24** (`atlas tree`), **26** (do
File Rules reach below the project root - a grilling ticket), **27** (duplicates as a
`doctor` finding, via fclones), **28** (more content filters - DXF, true content type),
08 (global search scope), 09 (dossier Companion Mode), and 11 (Drive API read path).
Nothing is blocked. 25 is resolved.

26 is the natural next one: it is the only open question that can *change* what
shipped this session, and every week it stays open is a week of rules written against
roots-only semantics that may later want to reach deeper.

*The section below is the session-9 frontier, kept for the reasoning.*

**As of session 9:** unblocked and unclaimed are **24** (`atlas tree` - ticket 22's
retroactive parity debt under ADR 0008, charted and deliberately not folded into
another ticket's commit), 08 (global search scope), 09 (dossier Companion Mode),
and 11 (Drive API read path). Nothing is blocked. 10 and 23 are resolved.

24 is the natural next one: it is small, it discharges an obligation that is
already overdue, and it is the cheapest real test of whether the ticket 07 seam is
a seam - a second consumer that is not a Textual widget either uses it cleanly or
exposes what the widget was carrying.

*The section below is the session-7 frontier, kept for the reasoning.*

Unblocked and unclaimed: 08, 09, 10, 11, and the tree's writes, which is not yet
a ticket.
Blocked: none.
Resolved: 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

**Nothing is blocked any more.** Every remaining ticket is takeable.

**The tree reads; it does not write yet.** Ticket 22 built the widget and the
Tree Region now draws a real project. What is missing is the other half of ADR
0006: the repair keys on a node, the inline confirm on the operation line, and the
per-project undo stack. Core has all of it already - `build_repair_plan`,
`invert_plan`, `Guard.for_action` - so this is TUI work against a settled surface.
Chart it as ticket 23 before building it.

**Ticket 10 has now slipped three times.** Sessions 6, 7 and 8 each added surface
that inherits the unanswered accessibility and CLI-parity question: a wordmark,
five keybindings, three Regions, two Compositions, an undo stack, an inline
confirm, and now a tree with its own glyph vocabulary and colour-carried state.
The colour-carries-meaning question is no longer hypothetical - at narrow widths
the tree drops the words and leaves the glyph and its colour to say what is
wrong.

Two build tickets are ready and independent of each other:

- **21, the core write surface.** Test-first, no TUI, fixture drives only.
  `conform` gets better whether the tree ships or not. The lowest-risk next
  session.
- **20, the console shell.** The frame from ADR 0005 with placeholders in the Tree
  and Companion Regions, so the tree later lands into a layout that already works
  at every width.

**07 is the seam** and is the largest remaining decision. It is unblocked now but
reads better after 21 exists, because 21 settles what core actually hands over.

**10 is the one that keeps slipping.** Sessions 6 and 7 each added surface that
inherits the unanswered accessibility question - a wordmark, five keybindings,
three Regions, two Compositions, and now an undo stack and an inline confirm on
the operation line. It has been recommended forward twice and taken neither time.

## Session 8 - four tickets, test-first

21, 07, 15 and 20 in that order, driven through `/tdd`. 339 tests pass, up from
261 at the start of the day. Repo lint green throughout. Continuity for the run is
in `.agent/handoff/atlas-tdd-four-tickets.md`.

- **21, the core write surface.** `Move` and `Action.moved` give every applied
  action a manifest; `build_repair_plan` slices one Action out of the Plan conform
  already builds; `invert_plan` reverses it from manifests and refuses outright
  when a Backfill, a file-empty removal, or a Conflict leaves nothing to reverse.
  `Guard` now exists at two scopes with three tests running them side by side.
  Path length warns from `build_plan`; `long_path()` is still absent from every
  write path.
- **07 and 15, the seam and its aftermath.** A lazily-expanding handle,
  `core.tree`. Below the root, where `report_project` has no opinion, containment
  decides Filing State. The Node Key is the project-relative path. After a write
  the tree reconciles by Move Manifest - the same two folders the scoped guard
  watched - and the cursor follows what it repaired. ADR 0007.
- **20, the console shell.** Layout rules as a pure module, `tui/layout.py`, with
  `app.py` applying them. Three Regions, two Compositions, collapse, navigation,
  Companion Modes, narrow chrome. The health modal is gone and Enter is reclaimed.
- **22, the tree widget** - charted this session and built. A plain `Tree` over
  `core.tree` in the Tree Region: labels as `Text`, `label_width` that adds up
  rather than renders, non-exclusive per-node workers, no expand-all, `select_key`
  through `call_after_refresh`.

Two corrections found by building rather than deciding:

- **Only control-plane Expectations are repairable.** ADR 0006 said an unmet
  Expectation is a Backfill. Conform has never created a mapped section and would
  report an unknown item and skip it. Recorded on ADR 0007 rather than left to be
  discovered by an operator pressing a key that does nothing.
- **In Textual, hiding a binding and disabling it are the same return value.**
  Sizing the footer through `check_action` disabled every action key at 80 columns.
  The narrow chrome is its own widget now.
- **Readness and expansion were sharing one glyph.** Sixteen widget tests passed
  while every closed folder drew an open triangle, because the Companion prefetches
  every mapped section and those folders really were Read. Found by rendering the
  screen, not by testing it. `tokens.disclosure` separates the two now.

## Session 9 - the debt, then the writes

Tickets 10 and 23. **405 tests**, up from 360 at the start of the day. Repo lint
green. Continuity for the run is in
`.agent/handoff/atlas-session-9-ten-then-twentythree.md`.

**10, taken at last after slipping sessions 6, 7 and 8.** Grilled to a decision in
three rounds. Two facts found while answering it reframed the ticket: the
accessibility justification traced to a synthetic persona and Textual's unresolved
#2425 rather than to an operator, and `--json` has zero consumers anywhere in this
repo. Both recorded rather than glossed.

The rule: **a CLI form is owed by every capability that writes and every capability
that produces a fact; navigation is exempt**, and the obligation is discharged in
the same session as the surface, never in a later ticket - which is precisely how
this one slipped three times.

The defect behind it was worse than the ticket described. Dropping the Filing State
word at narrow width left Drifted, Misplaced and Loose rendering identically **to
everyone**, because ADR 0004 has them share a glyph and a colour by design and the
word was the only separator; what remained measured **1.82:1**, vermilion against
ochre, on the red/green axis. The word now abbreviates - `NAME` `PLACE` `LOOSE`
`UNMAPPED` - and is never dropped. The trigger was measuring the wrong thing too:
`SPLIT_COLUMNS` stripped labels at 87 columns, where Single-Region gives the tree
nearly the whole terminal, so `ABBREVIATE_COLUMNS` is its own named 60. ADR 0008.

**23, the tree's writes, built test-first.** `tui/repair.py` pure like
`tui/layout.py`; `f` means "conform what has focus"; an inline confirm on the
operation line that Enter commits and Escape abandons; `u` undoes, per Project, no
redo. `conform --node PATH` and `conform --revert FILE` are the CLI half, and
`--revert` needed `plan_from_dict` because `action_to_dict` had no inverse and the
Move Manifest was write-only.

**Five bugs, two of them design errors in shipped ADRs.**

- `Guard.for_action` cannot guard an undo: it re-derives the Plan from the map and
  an undo reverses the map, so it refused every undo on an unchanged drive. ADR
  0006 had claimed one guard served both. `Guard.for_undo` now exists.
- `reconcile` missed the folder a merge consumed, because every Move in a merge
  names a *child*. The tree drew a row for a directory that no longer existed, as
  Mapped - the ghost ADR 0004 rules out. `follow` already knew this in a comment.
- **The Tree Region could not take keyboard focus at all.** `#tree` is a `Vertical`
  and `Vertical.focus()` is a no-op, so the tree widget shipped in session 8
  entirely unreachable by keyboard while sixteen widget tests passed. Fixing it
  exposed Textual's `Tree` taking Atlas's Enter, and a drilled tree having no
  cursor until an arrow key moved it.

Corrections are on ADR 0006 and ADR 0007, where the ADRs are.

**The render scripts are now in the repo**, at `tools/atlas/scripts/`, with a
README saying why. Three consecutive sessions have had a real defect found by
looking at the screen and missed by a green suite, and the pattern is consistent:
tests assert on what the app *believes* - `_focus_region`, `display`, a Filing
State - and not on what it draws or what the keyboard reaches.

## Notes for the next session

The working tree is clean and `main` is ahead of `origin/main` and unpushed - now
by 28 commits. Pushing has never been asked for. `git fetch` before surveying
anyway.

**Render the screen before believing the suite.** `tools/atlas/scripts/` holds the
fixture builder and two renderers, and its README lists the three defects a green
suite has now missed in a row. The fixture puts `11 Meetings` beside `Meetings` on
purpose, so the rename is a merge - the plain-rename case hid one of them.

**`space` changed meaning without being decided.** With focus working, it toggles
a folder when the tree has focus and marks a project when the list does. That
falls out of Textual's own bindings and is almost certainly right, but nobody
argued it. Worth a look in use.

**The published design sheet is gone.** The artifact this file cites, and that
tickets 02 and 03 cite, no longer resolves for this account. Anything needing
those renders has to re-render them.

**One intermittent TUI test.** `test_edit_project_prepopulates_and_confirms_folder_rename`
failed once with a Textual `NoMatches` during a full run and has passed alone and
in four consecutive full runs since. Timing, not the session's work.

Prototype renderers for the wordmark and the three visual worlds live only in the
session scratchpad and are deliberately throwaway. They are not Atlas code. When
the wordmark ships, its glyph table, extrusion compositor and ramp sampler get
written fresh into `tools/atlas` under test - do not lift the prototype.

The published design sheet at
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/4a9756ec-d166-44d0-b76d-ddd9979fbbc6 is now out of
date in **two** ways, not one. It still draws missing folders inline in the tree,
which ticket 14 ruled out. And its renders are all 132x38, a width that ticket 03
established is not one the user actually works at. It has not been re-rendered and
the user has not said whether to.

## Session 10 - the map learned to read files

Ticket 25, from a question the user asked directly: which open-source projects could
Atlas download and use to get stronger at managing and organizing files. The survey is
`docs/research/atlas-file-management-oss.md` and is indexed from root `AGENTS.md`, with
a per-row backlog table that is meant to be maintained rather than read once.

**The survey's finding is a filter, not a shortlist.** Every Atlas write crosses a
Plan, is guarded, logged and reversible. So a tool that mutates on its own - organize's
actions, f2's undo, fclones' dedupe - can only ever contribute its *design*, while a
tool that reads contributes its code. That single line sorted every candidate, and it
is why the thing adopted was pypdf and the thing ported was organize's rule vocabulary.

**File Rules.** `fileRules` in the drive map: `extensions`, `names`, `nameRegex`,
`pdfText`, ANDed, first match wins, after the glob relocations. A match emits the SWEEP
that Loose already earned - so the tree, the repair key, the inline confirm, the Guard,
the Move Manifest, undo, `conform --node` and `conform --revert` all took it without a
line of change. ADR 0006 held with room to spare. ADR 0009, vocabulary in `/CONTEXT.md`.

452 tests, up from 405. Tickets 26, 27, 28 graduated.

Four things found by building rather than deciding:

- **Most issued sets are encrypted.** Not with a password - with *permissions*, which
  Acrobat writes as AES. Without `pypdf[crypto]` and an empty-password attempt, the
  headline use case matches nothing and says nothing. `cryptography` is therefore
  Atlas's first native dependency; it ships Windows wheels, so the editable install is
  unaffected.
- **pypdf prints to stderr on a damaged file**, through logging's last-resort handler -
  which under the console draws over the screen. **pytest cannot see this**: it attaches
  its capture handlers to non-propagating loggers too, so an in-process test passes
  whether or not Atlas silenced it. Both regression tests run in a subprocess. This is
  the same lesson as the render scripts, in a new place: the suite asserts on what the
  app believes.
- **A rule is the first Filing State that can change without the directory changing.**
  Edit a PDF's title block and a Loose file stops being Loose with no listing moved.
  The Guard copes - it re-derives before writing - but the tree's 60-second Shelf Life
  keys on listings, so a row can be stale for a minute. Recorded on ADR 0009.
- **The operation line spoke two vocabularies.** It armed a repair as `file X -> Y` and
  reported it as `sweep X -> Y`, and undoing a sweep printed `-> ` with nothing after
  it, because the project root's path is the empty string. Pre-existing, found by
  running the keys and looking. `tui/repair.result_line`, with tests.

**Fixed a genuinely intermittent test rather than living with it.**
`test_edit_project_prepopulates_and_confirms_folder_rename` raced the confirm modal's
mount - one `pilot.pause()` where the modal can be the active screen a frame before its
buttons exist. It now uses this file's own `settle()`. Verified 5/5 on the file and
0/10 failures alone; the session-9 note about it can be considered closed.

**The machine, not the code:** a full-suite run hung twice, in
`socket.accept` inside `asyncio.new_event_loop`. The machine was at 48,000-51,000
sockets in `TIME_WAIT` (Windows has ~16k ephemeral ports) from other pytest and
coverage processes running concurrently. Per-file runs pass; the full suite is a
lottery while that is true. If a suite hangs and the stack bottoms out in
`_fallback_socketpair`, check `netstat -an | grep -c TIME_WAIT` before suspecting the
diff.

## Notes for session 11

`fileRules` is **inert until a drive's map carries the key**, and this session
deliberately did not touch the studio drive or its map. The schema table in
`atlas-tui-spec.md` on the shared drive still needs `fileRules` added by hand.

**Measure the hydration cost before writing a broad content rule on the real drive.**
Reading a file on the Drive mount downloads it. Atlas bounds this four ways (name
filters first, `*.pdf` only, 64 MB limit, cached by path+size+mtime) but none of it has
been measured against Google Drive File Stream, because development never touches it.
`atlas-tui-ux-evidence.md` already said "do not preload files on the shared drive" for
exactly this reason.

**`main`'s history was rewritten on 2026-09-10** - `prompts/Random Notes/` removed from
every commit, a passwords file among them, so every hash before `6a24914` changed
(session 9's tip was `bc506bf`, now `8ac4591`). Anything branched from an old hash has
to be `git rebase --onto main <old-base>`; a plain merge brings the deleted files back.
This session's work was uncommitted at the time and needed nothing. Lint and the full
suite were re-run against the rewritten `main`: green, 455 tests.

**`scripts/lint.sh` reports every JSON file invalid when `jq` is missing**, which reads
as 18 real failures and is not one. `jq` is installed on this machine but WinGet's
`Links` directory is not on the Git Bash PATH; prepend
`$LOCALAPPDATA/Microsoft/WinGet/Packages/jqlang.jq_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe`.
A python3 fallback that also names which validator ran is committed on branch
`atlas-agents-md` (`cd6ec2b`), separately from that branch's feature commit.

A second session (`skills-for-architects-ff`) worked in parallel on the AGENTS.md /
CLAUDE.md control plane, ADR 0010, branch `atlas-agents-md`, and bumped Atlas to 0.4.0.
It expects conflicts against this session's uncommitted hunks in `core/mapfile.py`,
`core/doctor.py`, `cli.py`, `tests/conftest.py`, `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md` and
`pyproject.toml`, and will resolve them on its side once this work lands. AGENTS.md
being control plane is good news here: `explained` already covers it, so no `*.md` rule
can sweep it.
