**16 skills** and **3 commands** across **6 plugins** for architects, designers, and AEC professionals.

## What Are Skills and Commands?

- **Skills** are domain knowledge units (nouns). They teach Claude about a design topic — like calculating occupancy loads, analyzing zoning envelopes, or writing CSI specs.
- **Commands** are workflows (verbs). They chain multiple skills together to accomplish a task — like running a full FF&E extraction pipeline or complete site due diligence.
- **Plugins** are the containers. Each groups related skills and commands by topic.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Skills | Commands | Description |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| [programming](./programming) | 2 | 1 | Workplace strategy: space programs, occupancy loads, IBC compliance. |
| [site-planning](./site-planning) | 5 | 1 | Site research, analysis, and design brief building. |
| [zoning-analysis](./zoning-analysis) | 1 | — | Buildable envelope analysis from zoning regulations and GIS data. |
| [specifications](./specifications) | 2 | — | CSI outline specs and construction punch lists. |
| [data-management](./data-management) | 4 | 1 | FF&E spec extraction, cleanup, and image processing. |
| [presentations](./presentations) | 2 | — | Slide deck generation and color palette creation. |

## Quick Start

### Install a Single Plugin

```bash
claude install github:AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects/programming
```

### Install All Plugins

```bash
claude install github:AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects
```

Skills are symlinked into `~/.claude/skills/` so they stay in sync when you update.
