**17 skills** and **3 commands** across **6 plugins** for architects, designers, and AEC professionals.

## What Are Skills and Commands?

- **Skills** are domain knowledge units (nouns). They teach Claude about a design topic — like calculating occupancy loads, analyzing zoning envelopes, or writing CSI specs.
- **Commands** are workflows (verbs). They chain multiple skills together to accomplish a task — like running a full FF&E extraction pipeline or complete site due diligence.
- **Plugins** are the containers. Each groups related skills and commands by topic.

## Plugins

Organized by project lifecycle — from site research through delivery.
