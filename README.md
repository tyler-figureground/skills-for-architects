# Skills for Architects

> Agentic skills, commands, and plugins for Claude — use with [Claude Desktop (Cowork)](https://claude.ai/download) or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). From site research to zoning, programming, specifications, and creative delivery.

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

**17 skills** and **3 commands** across **6 plugins** for architects, designers, and AEC professionals.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Desktop** (recommended) or **Claude Code CLI**
- A [Claude subscription](https://claude.ai) (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise)

## What Are Skills and Commands?

- **Skills** are domain knowledge units (nouns). They teach Claude about a design topic — like calculating occupancy loads, analyzing zoning envelopes, or writing CSI specs.
- **Commands** are workflows (verbs). They chain multiple skills together to accomplish a task — like running a full FF&E extraction pipeline or complete site due diligence.
- **Plugins** are the containers. Each groups related skills and commands by topic.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Claude Desktop — recommended

1. Open **Customize** → **Browse plugins** → click **+** → **Add marketplace from GitHub**
2. Enter `AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects`
3. Install the plugins you want from the **Personal** tab
4. Type `/skills` in any conversation to verify

Updates sync through the marketplace automatically.

### Option B: Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
# Install a single plugin
claude install github:AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects/01-site-planning

# Or install all plugins
claude install github:AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects
```

Skills are symlinked into `~/.claude/skills/` so they stay in sync when you update.

## Contributing

Want to add a skill for the built environment? Here's how:

1. **Fork** this repo
2. Create your skill in the appropriate plugin folder (or propose a new plugin)
3. Each skill needs:
   - A `SKILL.md` with clear instructions and domain knowledge
   - A `README.md` with install, usage, and sample output
   - Any supporting data files in a `data/` or `zoning-rules/` directory
4. Open a **pull request** — describe what the skill does, how you tested it, and sample output
