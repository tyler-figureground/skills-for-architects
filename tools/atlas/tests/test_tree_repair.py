"""The tree's write keys, end to end (ticket 23, ADR 0006 and 0007).

Real keys against a real widget through ``App.run_test``, on a fixture drive.
The rule these exercise lives in ``tui/repair.py`` and is tested purely there;
what is asserted here is that pressing a key on a node actually moves a folder,
that nothing moves before the confirm, and that the cursor follows what it
repaired.
