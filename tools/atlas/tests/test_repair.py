"""What a repair key means on a node, and what the operation line says about it.

Pure, like `tui/layout.py` and for the same reason: the rule is worth testing
without a widget in the way. `app.py` applies what this decides and owns none of
it.

ADR 0006 is the contract - the tree invents no action kinds, and confirmation
weight follows plan size. ADR 0007 carries the correction that bites hardest
here: only control-plane Expectations are repairable.
