"""The ProjectTree seam: one project's folders and files, read lazily.

The TUI owns interaction and the widget; this module owns filesystem facts. It
hands out immutable ``TreeNode`` values and keeps a mutable cache behind them,
the same division ``tui.model.ProjectRow`` makes between a stable value and the
scan that produced it.

Reading is lazy - one ``os.scandir`` per displayed folder, never a walk - and
every call is side-effect free, so a TUI worker that abandons one mid-flight
costs nothing but the read. See ADR 0007.
