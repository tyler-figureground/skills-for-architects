"""Read-only drive/project inventory.

Scans are dirent-driven (names + is_dir), never mtime-heavy: enumeration is the
unit of cost on the Google Drive mount, and the dirent already carries the type,
so is_dir is free. File counts recurse only into relocation-source folders, which
are small by construction.

Enumeration reports whether it succeeded. A folder Atlas could not open and a
folder with nothing in it both yield zero entries, and for a tool whose product is
"what is filed and what is missing" those must never render alike - a false
negative here reads as fact. See ADR 0004 for the Load State model.
