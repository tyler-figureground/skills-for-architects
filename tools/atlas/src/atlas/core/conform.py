"""P3: conform a project to the map - plan, then apply.

The plan is derived from doctor's ProjectReport (one fact-gathering pass, one
brain). Apply executes in fixed order: control-plane backfill, driftMap
renames, relocations, sweeps. Safety rules are the spec's section 6, verbatim:
deletions are rmdir-shaped (file-empty only), moves never clobber (collisions
survive in place and are reported), case-only renames go through a temp name,
every applied action is logged.

Control-plane backfill is constructive only. Missing files are created
exclusively. An existing PROJECT.md without the machine contract is reported
as a conflict and left unchanged; nothing existing is overwritten.
