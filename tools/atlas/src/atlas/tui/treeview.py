"""The Tree Region's widget: a plain Textual Tree over ``atlas.core.tree``.

Every non-obvious choice here is a measurement from ticket 05 rather than a
preference, and each is commented where it lands: a plain ``Tree`` instead of
``DirectoryTree``, labels built as ``rich.text.Text``, per-node workers that are
not exclusive, no expand-all, and a ``get_label_width`` that does not build a
label to measure one.

Colour and glyphs come from ``tui.tokens``. Tree nodes are not DOM nodes and take
no CSS at all, which is the whole reason the token layer owns them.
