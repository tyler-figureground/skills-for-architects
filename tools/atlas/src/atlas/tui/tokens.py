"""The single source of truth for how Atlas looks.

Python owns the palette and the CSS is generated from it, not the other way
round. That direction is forced: Textual tree nodes are not DOM nodes and take no
CSS at all, so ``render_label`` has to read colours and glyphs from Python. Having
the stylesheet own them too would guarantee drift between the tree and everything
around it.

The world is POCHE with an EMBER ramp (ticket 02). Solid mass is a folder filed
correctly; hatched is a folder with something wrong. Colour then answers whether
Atlas can fix it or a person has to decide. See ADR 0004 for the state model.
