"""What a repair key means on a node, and what the operation line says about it.

Pure, like ``tui/layout.py``: given a node, this decides whether the repair key
does anything and what to tell the operator when it does not. ``app.py`` applies
the answer and owns none of the rule.

The tree invents no action kinds (ADR 0006). Every repair it offers is a
one-Action slice of the Plan conform already builds, so this module never decides
*what* to do - only whether there is anything to offer and what to say.
