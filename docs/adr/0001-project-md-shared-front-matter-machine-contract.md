# PROJECT.md YAML front-matter is the shared machine contract every architect skill reads

accepted

## Context

The facts that actually govern a code answer - jurisdiction, occupancy group, construction
type, sprinklered, the existing C-of-O occupant cap, the Place-of-Assembly strategy, the
tenancy - had nowhere consistent to live. They were scattered across spreadsheets, Google
Docs, and ad-hoc `Context.md` files the tools can't read (Norma BL-013), and nothing checked
that the scope Norma adopted actually matched the drawing under review (Norma BL-014). The 211
Centre review made this concrete: Norma's `project.py active` returned a *different* job (FiDi
Office), and the controlling facts (existing C-of-O cap = 74 floor-wide, PA strategy, existing
2 exits, multi-tenant floor) only existed in an external `Context.md` that didn't fit the thin
`projects/*.yaml` schema.

Two separate tools needed the same facts from the same place: this repo's `09-project-dossier`
skill (which *writes* a project's facts as it interviews the architect) and the Norma engine
(which *reads* them to auto-scope a calculation). A human-readable dossier table alone is not
machine-parseable; a separate Norma-only profile file would re-introduce the re-keying the
dossier exists to remove.

This record concerns a contract that spans two repos - the `skills-for-architects` dossier
that writes it and the Norma engine that reads it. It is recorded here, in
`skills-for-architects`, because this repo *authors* the contract: the `09-project-dossier`
skill defines, populates, and maintains the `PROJECT.md` front-matter, so the schema's source
of truth and its decision record live together. (This ADR establishes the repo's `docs/adr/`
convention; the Norma engine - the contract's consumer - references this decision from its own
`docs/adr/`.)

## Decision

Reuse the dossier's `PROJECT.md` as the **one** project file, and put a compact YAML
**front-matter block** at its head that is the shared machine contract for every architect
skill. The human dossier tables stay below it; `Context.md` remains optional narrative;
`decisions/` holds rationale.

- **The contract is the front-matter keys.** Twelve governing keys -
  `jurisdiction (nyc|california|other)`, `edition`, `occupancy_group`, `construction_type`,
  `sprinklered`, `stories`, `building_area_sf`, `frontage_ft`, `existing_co_occupant_load`,
  `existing_exits`, `place_of_assembly_strategy`, `tenancy` - plus optional `project`/`name`
  and `address`. The last four close Norma BL-013 directly: they are exactly the facts that
  decide an egress answer and had no schema slot before.
- **The dossier writes it; the engine reads it.** `/project-dossier init`/`update` populates
  and maintains the front-matter and mirrors the key rows into human tables (the table stays
  the source of truth for provenance; front-matter and tables are kept in sync). Norma's
  `project.py` resolves the active profile by reading the workspace `PROJECT.md`
  front-matter, falling back to the engine's `projects/*.yaml` examples when no real
  front-matter is present.
- **Blank means unknown.** Only a `PROJECT.md` whose front-matter carries a real
  `jurisdiction`/`occupancy_group`/`edition` is adopted as scope; an all-blank stub (what
  `New-Project.ps1` scaffolds) correctly falls through to the engine examples rather than
  hijacking scope with empty values.
- **Scope is guarded, not assumed (Norma BL-014).** Norma's `project.py scope-check
  <address-or-name>` compares the active project's name/address against a supplied string
  (e.g. the drawing's title-block address) by ≥3-char token overlap and warns - non-zero
  exit - before the wrong jurisdiction/occupancy/sprinkler scope is silently adopted.

## Consequences

One file now carries both the human dossier and the machine scope, so the architect keys a
fact once and every skill - studio and Norma alike - reads the same value; closes Norma BL-013
(the governing facts have a representable home) and BL-014 (the scope-check guard). The
round-trip is proven: a dossier-produced `PROJECT.md` (CA / A-2 / II-A / NFPA 13) resolves
through `norma project active` to the right jurisdiction/occupancy/construction/sprinklered
plus the four extended fields.

The contract is now a coupling surface: the front-matter key names and value vocabularies
(`nyc|california|other`, the occupancy/construction strings) are an interface shared across
two repos, so renaming a key or changing a value's spelling is a breaking change on both
sides and must move together. Front-matter and the mirrored human tables can also drift; the
dossier's hard rule keeps them in sync with the table as the provenance source of truth, but
a hand-edited `PROJECT.md` can desync until the next `/project-dossier update`. The
front-matter is trusted as authoritative when present - a wrong value there silently
mis-scopes every downstream calculation, which is why `scope-check` exists as the backstop.
