# Changelog

All notable changes to **Architecture Studio** (`AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects`) are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- **`PATTERNS.md` rule #6 expanded.** Versioning discipline now spans three artifacts that must move together on every shipped change: the JSON `version` field (`plugin.json` and/or `marketplace.json` `metadata.version`), a git tag (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z`), and a GitHub release (`gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes-file <changelog-section>`). The rule previously stopped at JSON + CHANGELOG, leaving repo discoverability gaps — `git checkout v1.1.0` didn't resolve, no shareable release URL existed. Backfilled tags + releases for `v1.1.0` (this repo) and `v0.2.0` (canoa).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **`PATTERNS.md`** — canonical reference for ALPA's plugin and marketplace conventions. Ten principles distilled from canoa V1, normativa v0.8, and skills-for-architects v1.0: small one-verb skills, dispatcher matching plugin name, `<plugin>-<verb>` naming for single-plugin layouts, marker-driven rules, version bump per ship, public default, MCP bundling via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, hard rules captured from real production bugs. Linked from README. Rule #6 (versioning) covers both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` `metadata.version`.
- `.gitignore` covering macOS, editor, and local-env artifacts.
- `scripts/lint.sh` — repo lint script with six structural checks: no tracked `.DS_Store`, JSON validity, SKILL.md frontmatter (`name` + `description` required), count consistency (plugins, per-plugin skill counts, marketplace.json), internal markdown link resolution, and shellcheck on `hooks/*.sh`.
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` — runs `scripts/lint.sh` on push to `main` and on every PR.

### Changed

- **Disclaimer hook is now marker-driven, not keyword-sniffed.** `rules/professional-disclaimer.md` now requires every regulatory output to end with the canonical disclaimer block followed by `<!-- architecture-studio:requires-disclaimer -->`. The `post-write-disclaimer-check` hook checks for the marker and verifies the canonical block is present, instead of pattern-matching keywords like `FAR`, `setback`, `egress`. This eliminates false positives on non-regulatory documents that mention regulated terms in passing (READMEs, changelogs, meeting notes) and false negatives on terse regulatory replies that happen not to use those keywords.
- **Skill counts now reflect actual file count.** README headline, details summary, plugin table, and the dispatcher's `/skills` menu all read **37 skills** (up from "35"). The 2-skill gap was the dispatcher's `/studio` and `/skills`, which were uncounted by convention. The README catalog now includes a Dispatcher section listing them. `scripts/lint.sh` enforces that headline, details summary, catalog row count, plugin-table per-row counts, skills-menu, and `marketplace.json` plugin list all match the real file count — drift fails CI.

### Removed

- 11 tracked `.DS_Store` files. Now ignored repo-wide via `.gitignore`.
