# How we build plugins at ALPA

This is the canonical reference for how we build Claude plugins and marketplaces at [Alpaca Design Lab](https://alpa.llc). It applies to:

- [`AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects`](https://github.com/AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects) — multi-plugin marketplace for architects (this repo)
- [`AlpacaLabsLLC/canoa`](https://github.com/AlpacaLabsLLC/canoa) — single-plugin marketplace, AI specifications manager for FF&E
- [`Estudio-Local/normativa`](https://github.com/Estudio-Local/normativa) — single-plugin marketplace, Maldonado UY zoning toolkit
- Any future plugin we ship

The patterns are deliberately opinionated. They emerged from real iteration cycles — we tried alternatives, hit problems, encoded the fixes here. WHY each rule exists is documented inline; treat that as a constraint when judging edge cases.

## 1. Small skills, one verb each

Each skill does one thing. Frontmatter is short, body is focused. If a `SKILL.md` exceeds ~500 lines or starts handling multiple verbs in sequence (onboard + work + audit + write), decompose it into separate skills.

- `name` matches the directory and is kebab-case
- `description` is pushy and trigger-phrase-rich — model invocation depends on it picking your skill out of the dispatcher's pool
- `allowed-tools` is scoped to what THIS skill actually needs, not the union of everything the plugin can touch
- Optional flags: `user-invocable: true` when the skill is meant to be slash-invoked; `disable-model-invocation: true` when slash-only

**Why:** smaller skills are easier to test, slash-invoke directly, restrict tool access on, and reason about. Monoliths drift; small skills stay honest. We split canoa's monolithic SKILL.md into 8 verb-scoped skills the same day we couldn't keep `/canoa:start`'s 200-line body internally consistent.

## 2. Clear contracts between skills

Skills hand off via explicit cross-references in their bodies — never via implicit shared state.

- Each skill documents what input it expects, what it produces, what it hands off to next
- Cross-references use the actual slash invocation: "After this completes, run `/canoa-add-to-sheet`"
- Outputs are typed (named JSON schemas, file paths with conventions, not freeform)
- Hard rules that span multiple skills (audit-on-touch, read-before-write) live in the dispatcher AND get repeated in each sub-skill that touches them — never assume the user invoked the dispatcher first

**Why:** designers (and Claude) shouldn't have to remember which skill writes what file or which expects which keys. The contract is in the SKILL.md body, in plain English, with examples.

## 3. Clean naming conventions

| Layer | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Marketplace name | kebab-case product family | `canoa`, `normativa`, `skills-for-architects` |
| Plugin name | kebab-case (matches marketplace name when single-plugin) | `canoa`, `norma`, `00-due-diligence` |
| Dispatcher skill name | matches plugin name | `canoa`, `norma`, `studio` |
| Sub-skill name (single-plugin marketplace) | `<plugin>-<verb>` | `canoa-find`, `norma-analyze`, `norma-informe` |
| Sub-skill name (multi-plugin marketplace) | `<verb>` (already namespaced by plugin) | `nyc-landmarks`, `spec-writer`, `product-research` |

User-facing slash invocation:

- Single-plugin: `/canoa`, `/canoa-find`, `/canoa-audit` (plugin name = dispatcher; sub-skills carry the prefix)
- Multi-plugin: `/<plugin>:<skill>` (Claude Code/Cowork's namespacing) — but mention the family in marketplace docs

**Why:** the slash UX should immediately tell the user which product family they're invoking. `/canoa-find` and `/canoa-audit` are obviously a family. `/start` and `/audit` are anonymous.

## 4. A single orchestrator (dispatcher)

Every plugin has ONE entry-point skill (the dispatcher) that:

1. Reads the user's intent (everything after the slash command).
2. Classifies against a routing table.
3. Hands off to the right sub-skill.
4. Falls back to working mode (relay through MCP / agent persona) for ambiguous freeform messages.

The dispatcher is named the same as the plugin (`canoa`, `norma`, `studio`). Its `SKILL.md` includes:

- A routing table (what intent → which sub-skill)
- A working-mode fallback section (how to handle ambiguous requests)
- Any hard rules that apply globally across all sub-skills

Reference implementations:
- [`Estudio-Local/normativa/skills/norma/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/Estudio-Local/normativa/blob/main/skills/norma/SKILL.md)
- [`AlpacaLabsLLC/canoa/skills/canoa/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/AlpacaLabsLLC/canoa/blob/main/skills/canoa/SKILL.md)
- [`AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects/plugins/08-dispatcher/skills/studio/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects/blob/main/plugins/08-dispatcher/skills/studio/SKILL.md)

**Why:** users shouldn't have to memorize which sub-skill handles which intent. The dispatcher does the routing. New users can just type `/canoa` (or `/norma`) and describe what they need in plain English.

## 5. Clear rules across all plugins

Rules are cross-cutting conventions that apply to multiple skills. Examples: voice / tone, professional disclaimers, units & measurements, citation style, audit-on-touch.

- For multi-plugin marketplaces, put rules in a top-level `rules/` directory — referenced by per-plugin READMEs, enforced by hooks at marketplace level. See [`skills-for-architects/rules/`](./rules/).
- For single-plugin marketplaces, rules live in the dispatcher skill body and are repeated in each sub-skill that touches them.
- **Marker-driven hooks** — for enforceable rules, use HTML comment markers (e.g., `<!-- architecture-studio:requires-disclaimer -->`) that skills emit when they want the rule applied. Hooks check for the marker, not for keywords like "FAR" or "audit." See [`hooks/post-write-disclaimer-check.sh`](./hooks/post-write-disclaimer-check.sh).
- Hard rules in skills are stated explicitly in the body, with WHY they exist (often a past incident or strong invariant). E.g.: "Audit always re-parses. Reason: Eames bug where agent reported sheet value as verified when catalog had drifted to a newer price."

**Why:** keyword-sniffing hooks misfire on docs that mention regulated terms in passing (READMEs, changelogs, meeting notes) AND miss terse regulatory replies that happen not to use those keywords. Marker-driven enforcement eliminates both. Documenting WHY the rule exists lets future maintainers judge edge cases instead of blindly following the rule.

## 6. Clear versioning behavior

Two version fields, two scopes — both pinned, both bumped on every shipped change.

| Field | Where | Bumps when |
|---|---|---|
| `plugin.json` `version` | Per-plugin | The plugin's behavior changes — new skill, edited skill body, MCP tool added, etc. |
| `marketplace.json` `metadata.version` | Marketplace-wide | Anything the repo ships changes — including marketplace-level docs, top-level scripts/hooks/lint, marketplace.json structure itself, even if no individual plugin's behavior moves |

On EVERY shipped change:

1. Bump the relevant `version` (patch for fixes/docs, minor for new skills / behavior / non-breaking enhancements, major for breaking layout).
2. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` describing what changed.
3. Stage version bump + CHANGELOG + actual change in a single commit and push.
4. **Tag the commit:** `git tag -a vX.Y.Z <sha> -m "vX.Y.Z — short description"` and `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
5. **Cut the GitHub release:** `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z — …" --notes-file <changelog-section>` (extract the CHANGELOG section for that version into a temp file with `sed -n '/^## \[X\.Y\.Z\]/,/^## \[/p' CHANGELOG.md | sed '$d'`).

If a single change touches both plugin behavior and marketplace-level state, bump both versions in the same commit (one tag, one release — pick the higher-scope version for the tag name).

**Three artifacts must move together:** JSON `version` field, git tag, GitHub release. Bumping JSON without tagging leaves discoverability holes (no `git checkout v1.1.0`, no shareable release URL). Tagging without bumping JSON breaks Cowork's update mechanism. Cutting a release without a CHANGELOG entry leaves the release notes empty.

**Why:** Cowork and Claude Code pin to `plugin.json` `version` for plugin updates — without a bump, `/plugin marketplace update` reports "already up to date" even when new commits exist (canoa 2026-05-08: three commits, no bump, Cowork served `0.1.0` indefinitely). The marketplace `metadata.version` is more of a documentation pin than a functional one (`/plugin marketplace update` re-fetches regardless), but bumping it gives every shipped change a clear version trail in CHANGELOG. Git tags + GitHub releases give the same change a discoverable surface for humans — release URLs link from PRs, CHANGELOGs, and external docs; tags let `git checkout` against a known release point. We hit the gap three times on 2026-05-08: canoa shipped without a plugin.json bump; skills-for-architects shipped PATTERNS.md without a marketplace bump; both repos accumulated commits without git tags or GitHub releases. Bump discipline = every push leaves a trail across all three artifacts.

If you ever need auto-publish on every commit (during very heavy iteration), drop the `version` field entirely — Cowork/Code falls through to commit SHAs for plugin updates, and you can also skip per-commit tags. But default is the pin + bump + tag + release.

## 7. Layout pattern selection

| Layout | When | Marketplace source | Skills location |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Flat single-plugin** (normativa-style) | One plugin in the marketplace; the marketplace IS the plugin | `"./"` | `skills/<verb>/` at repo root |
| **Multi-plugin nested** (architects-style) | Two or more plugins sharing rules / agents / hooks at the marketplace level | `"./plugins/<name>"` | `plugins/<name>/skills/<verb>/` |

For both: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lives at the repo root. For single-plugin, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` lives next to it. For multi-plugin, each plugin has its own `<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

Don't pick the multi-plugin layout for a single plugin — adds nesting without payoff and forces awkward `/plugin:start` slash UX. Don't pick the flat layout when shipping multiple plugins — they'll collide on skill names.

## 8. MCP server bundling

Plugins that depend on an MCP server bundle it inside the plugin via `.mcp.json` at the plugin root, using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to resolve paths:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canoa": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/mcp/dist/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server source lives under `mcp/` (or `<plugin>/mcp/` for multi-plugin), with `dist/` committed so a fresh clone runs the MCP without rebuild. `mcp/node_modules/` is gitignored.

**Never require per-user wrangler / config-file edits.** The plugin install IS the MCP install.

## 9. Public over private

Default plugin marketplaces to **public GitHub repos** unless there's a deliberate strategic reason to keep them private. Public removes Cowork/Code auth friction, simplifies install for testers, and matches the OSS posture of Claude's plugin ecosystem.

Strategy moats live in **server-side product surface** (Canoa's catalog cache, Estudio Local's GIS pipeline, etc.) — not in plugin packaging or skill bodies. The plugin shape is mostly product surface, not strategy.

If kept private: use Cowork's Admin → Private Marketplace flow with the Claude GitHub App; expect [bug #28125](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/28125); have a ZIP-upload fallback ready.

## 10. Hard rules captured from real bugs

When a real bug surfaces in production / testing, encode the fix as a hard rule in the relevant skill body — not just a code patch. The rule survives refactors; the patch may not.

Examples from canoa V1:

- **Audit always re-parses** (Eames LCW bug 2026-05-07): agent reported stale sheet value as "verified-tier from Herman Miller." Rule: every audit invocation runs `parse_product_url` against the row's URL, even if the catalog cache is recent. Surfaces drift between sheet ↔ catalog ↔ live with provenance.
- **Read before write** (Norma Jean header bug 2026-05-07): agent guessed at column headers, USD landed in wrong column. Rule: `append_to_sheet` always preceded by `read_master_sheet` to map keys to actual headers. Use exact header names verbatim. Don't invent columns.
- **Update in place** (Eames LCW dupes 2026-05-07): refresh appended new rows instead of patching existing ones. Rule: when SKU match exists, use `update_row_by_match` — never append.
- **No fabricated capabilities**: agent claimed "background refresh" that doesn't exist. Rule: state only what the tools you just called actually did. Canoa V1 has no async workers.

Hard rules belong in the dispatcher skill (so they're inherited globally) AND in each sub-skill that touches the affected behavior (so they're enforced even if the dispatcher is bypassed).

## CI lint

Every marketplace repo should ship a structural lint (`scripts/lint.sh` + GitHub Actions workflow) that fails CI on:

1. Tracked `.DS_Store` files
2. Invalid JSON (`marketplace.json`, `plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, etc.)
3. SKILL.md frontmatter missing `name` or `description`
4. Count drift between README claims, plugin tables, marketplace.json plugin list, and actual file count
5. Broken internal markdown links
6. shellcheck on `hooks/*.sh`

See [`scripts/lint.sh`](./scripts/lint.sh) and [`.github/workflows/lint.yml`](./.github/workflows/lint.yml) for the reference implementation.

**Why:** drift between docs and reality is the #1 way plugin marketplaces get sloppy. The lint forces "if you claim 37 skills, there better be 37 SKILL.md files" — gives you a tight feedback loop on commit, eliminates a class of bugs that only surface when a user can't find the skill the README promised.

## Quick checklist for starting a new plugin

1. Decide layout: single-plugin (flat) or multi-plugin (nested)?
2. Pick names: marketplace, plugin, dispatcher (= plugin name), sub-skills (`<plugin>-<verb>`)
3. Create `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `plugin.json` (version `0.1.0`, semver pinned)
4. Write the dispatcher skill first — establish the routing table
5. Write each sub-skill as a thin shell with `allowed-tools` scoped
6. Bundle MCP via `.mcp.json` with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` if needed
7. Create top-level `agents/` for orchestration personas; multi-plugin: also `rules/`, `hooks/`
8. README at repo root with diagram + skill table + install instructions
9. CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE (MIT default), CLAUDE.md, `.gitignore` (`**/node_modules/`, per-user state dirs, `.wrangler/`)
10. Public visibility unless strategy says otherwise
11. CI lint on push (validates SKILL.md frontmatter, JSON manifests, count consistency)

## Versions of these patterns

- **2026-05-08** — Initial version. Distilled from canoa V1 (single-plugin), normativa v0.8 (single-plugin with shared rules + dispatcher), and skills-for-architects v1.0 (multi-plugin). Six core principles requested by Federico; expanded to ten with layout / MCP bundling / public-default / hard-rules / lint additions.
