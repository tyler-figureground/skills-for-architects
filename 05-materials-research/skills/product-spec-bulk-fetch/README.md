## Demo: 5-Product Batch

Real output from a batch of 5 URLs across Herman Miller, IKEA Puerto Rico, and RH:

```
| Product Name               | Brand          | Category  | W     | D     | H     | Unit | Price    | Currency |
|----------------------------|----------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| Eames Lounge Chair (LCW)   | Herman Miller  | Seating   | 21.75 | 25.25 | 26.50 | in   | 1235.00  | USD      |
| VARDAGEN Vaso               | IKEA           | Accessories|      |       | 5.00  | in   | 13.99    | USD      |
| KVOT Escurreplatos          | IKEA           | Accessories| 11.38| 18.88 | 9.00  | in   | 12.99    | USD      |

Fetched: 4/5 successful, 1 partial, 0 failed
```

Partial results (missing price, missing dimensions) are still included — blanks are better than skipped rows.

## Error Handling

The skill never stops a batch on a single failure:

- **Trade/dealer sites** with hidden pricing → row included, price left blank
- **Login-required pages** → logged as failed, batch continues
- **Non-product pages** → detected and skipped
- **Duplicate URLs** → deduplicated before fetching

After every batch: `Fetched: X/Y successful, Z partial, W failed` with a list of failed URLs and reasons.

## What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Extraction workflow, WebFetch prompts, output formatting rules |

## Pairs With

Use [`/product-spec-bulk-cleanup`](../product-spec-bulk-cleanup) after fetching to normalize casing, translate Spanish fields, standardize dimensions, and deduplicate. **Fetch → cleanup → spec-ready schedule.**
