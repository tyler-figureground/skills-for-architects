# /epd-compare — EPD Comparator

Compare 2 or more products side-by-side on environmental impact metrics. Validates comparability (declared units, system boundaries, PCR alignment), generates comparison tables with percentage deltas, and checks LEED v4.1 MRc2 eligibility.

This skill **reads** from the EPD Google Sheet but does **not write** to it. Output is a markdown comparison report.

## Input

The user provides EPD data in one of these ways:

1. **Sheet row references** — "compare rows 5, 8, and 12" from the EPD Google Sheet
2. **Inline data** — pasted product names with GWP values
3. **File path** — a CSV or markdown file with EPD data
4. **From prior skills** — "compare the EPDs I just parsed/found" (uses data from the current conversation)
5. **Mixed** — "compare this PDF I just parsed against what's in the sheet"

If the user doesn't specify a source, ask: **"Where is the EPD data? Sheet rows, pasted values, or from earlier in this conversation?"**

## Workflow

### Step 1: Collect data

Gather EPD data from the specified source. For each product, you need at minimum:

- Product name and manufacturer
- GWP (A1-A3) value
- Declared unit

Additional fields improve the comparison: ODP, AP, EP, POCP, energy use, water use, system boundary, PCR, validity dates, LEED eligibility.

### Step 2: Validate comparability

Before comparing, run these checks and report findings:

**Declared unit alignment:**
- Are all products using the same declared unit (e.g., all per m3, all per kg)?
- If units differ, attempt normalization where possible:
  - kg ↔ ton (multiply/divide by 1000)
  - m2 at different thicknesses (if thickness is known, normalize to same thickness)
- If normalization is impossible, warn: "Product A reports per m2, Product B reports per kg. Direct comparison requires density or thickness data. Provide conversion factors, or I'll compare only within matching units."
- **Never silently compare products with different declared units.**

**System boundary alignment:**
- Flag if some are cradle-to-gate (A1-A3) and others cradle-to-grave (A1-A3 + C1-C4 + D).
- Note: "A1-A3 comparison is still valid across both types. Full life cycle comparison is only valid for cradle-to-grave EPDs."

**PCR alignment:**
- Flag if products use different PCRs. Products under the same PCR are most directly comparable.
- Note the PCR names if they differ.

**EN 15804 version:**
- Flag if some use +A1 and others +A2. Impact indicator units may differ (AP in kg SO2e vs. mol H+ eq).
- GWP in kg CO2e is comparable across versions.

**Validity:**
- Flag any expired EPDs with their expiration date.

**EPD type:**
- Flag mix of product-specific and industry-average EPDs. Note that industry-average EPDs are less precise.

Report all findings before proceeding:

```
## Comparability Check

✓ Declared unit: All products use 1 m3
✓ System boundary: All cradle-to-gate (A1-A3)
⚠ PCR: Products 1-2 use NRMCA PCR, Product 3 uses NSF PCR — results are comparable but not identical methodology
⚠ Validity: Product 2 expired 2025-12-01
✓ EPD type: All product-specific
```

### Step 3: Generate comparison

Produce three outputs:

#### a. Side-by-side impact table

```
## Environmental Impact Comparison

| Metric | ECOPact (Holcim) | ProPaving (CEMEX) | ReadyMix (Buzzi) | Unit |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|------|
| **GWP-total (A1-A3)** | **242** | 298 | 385 | kg CO2e/m3 |
| GWP-fossil (A1-A3) | 238 | 291 | — | kg CO2e/m3 |
| GWP-biogenic (A1-A3) | 4 | 7 | — | kg CO2e/m3 |
| ODP (A1-A3) | 1.2e-6 | 1.5e-6 | 1.8e-6 | kg CFC-11e/m3 |
| AP (A1-A3) | 0.45 | 0.52 | 0.61 | kg SO2e/m3 |
| EP (A1-A3) | 0.08 | 0.11 | 0.14 | kg PO4e/m3 |
| PERE (A1-A3) | 180 | 95 | 72 | MJ/m3 |
| PENRE (A1-A3) | 1,450 | 1,890 | 2,340 | MJ/m3 |
| FW (A1-A3) | 0.32 | 0.41 | 0.55 | m3/m3 |
| Recycled Content | 35% | 22% | 12% | % |
```

Bold the **best value** in each row (lowest for impacts, highest for recycled content/renewable energy).

Use `—` for missing data. Never fill in missing values.

#### b. Percentage comparison (relative to lowest)

```
## GWP Comparison (relative to lowest)

| Product | GWP (A1-A3) | vs. Lowest | vs. Industry Avg |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| ECOPact (Holcim) | 242 kg CO2e/m3 | — baseline — | -40% |
| ProPaving (CEMEX) | 298 kg CO2e/m3 | +23% | -26% |
| ReadyMix (Buzzi) | 385 kg CO2e/m3 | +59% | -4% |
| *Industry average* | *~400 kg CO2e/m3* | — | — |
```

Include industry average baseline if known. Common baselines:
- Ready-mix concrete (4000 PSI): ~400 kg CO2e/m3 (NRMCA)
- Structural steel (hot-rolled): ~1.16 kg CO2e/kg (AISC)
- Rebar: ~0.83 kg CO2e/kg
- Mineral wool insulation: ~1.2 kg CO2e/kg
- Carpet tile: ~10 kg CO2e/m2

If you don't have a reliable baseline for the material, search for current CLF (Carbon Leadership Forum) or industry data rather than guessing.

#### c. LEED v4.1 MRc2 assessment

Include this section if the user mentions LEED, or if LEED eligibility data is available:

```
## LEED v4.1 MRc2 Assessment

### Option 1 — EPD Disclosure (1 point for 20+ products with EPDs)
| Product | Qualifying EPD? | Type | Notes |
|---------|----------------|------|-------|
| ECOPact | ✓ | Product-specific | Third-party verified, ISO 14025 conforming |
| ProPaving | ✓ | Product-specific | Third-party verified |
| ReadyMix | ✗ | Industry-average | Does not qualify — industry-average EPDs earn half credit |

### Option 2 — Embodied Carbon Optimization (up to 2 points)
Products must demonstrate GWP below category baseline:
| Product | GWP | Baseline | Delta | Qualifies? |
|---------|-----|----------|-------|------------|
| ECOPact | 242 | 400 | -40% | ✓ Yes — significant reduction |
| ProPaving | 298 | 400 | -26% | ✓ Yes |
| ReadyMix | 385 | 400 | -4% | Marginal — minimal reduction |
```

### Step 4: Recommendation summary

End with a brief recommendation:

```
## Recommendation

**ECOPact by Holcim** is the clear winner on environmental performance — 40% below
industry average GWP and lowest across all impact categories. The South Plainfield
plant is closest to the project site.

**ProPaving by CEMEX** is a strong second option if Holcim can't meet schedule or
volume requirements — still 26% below average.

Both qualify for LEED MRc2 Option 1 and Option 2 credits.
```

Be direct and opinionated. The user wants a recommendation, not just data.

### Step 5: Save output

Save the comparison report as markdown:

- **Default path**: `~/Documents/Alpaca Labs/{client}/Working/epd-comparison-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- If the user says it's final: `~/Documents/Alpaca Labs/{client}/Deliverables/`
- If no client context: `~/Documents/Alpaca Labs/Alpa/Deliverables/`
- Ask the user if they want a different path

After saving:

```
Comparison saved to [path].

Next steps:
- /epd-to-spec — generate spec language using ECOPact's GWP (242) as the threshold
- /epd-research — find more options to compare
```

## Edge Cases

- **Single product**: Can't compare, but can still show the data card with industry average context. Suggest finding more EPDs to compare against.
- **Mixed material categories**: Warn that cross-material comparison (e.g., concrete vs. steel) is generally not meaningful because declared units and functional roles differ. Offer to group by category.
- **Incomplete data**: Compare on whatever fields are available. Use `—` for missing values. Note which products have more complete data.
- **All expired EPDs**: Proceed with comparison but add a prominent warning that results are based on expired declarations and should be verified with current EPDs.
- **Very large comparisons (10+ products)**: Show summary table first, then offer to drill into top 3-5 candidates.

## Notes

- **This skill reads, not writes.** It does not add rows to the EPD Google Sheet. It produces a comparison report as a markdown file.
- **Industry baselines change.** Search for current values rather than relying on hardcoded numbers. CLF and NRMCA publish updated baselines periodically.
- **GWP (A1-A3) is the primary metric** for most comparisons and LEED. Other indicators (ODP, AP, EP) provide a fuller picture but GWP drives most specification decisions.
- **Suggest next skills.** After comparison, the natural next steps are `/epd-to-spec` (to write spec language) or `/epd-research` (to find alternatives).
