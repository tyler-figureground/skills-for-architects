# The tree's write keys, the inline confirm, and the undo stack

## Question

The tree reads. It does not write. Ticket 22 built the widget over the seam ticket
07 settled, and ADR 0006's other half has never been built: **the repair keys on a
node, the inline confirm on the operation line, and the per-project undo stack.**

Core already has all of it. Ticket 21 built and tested `build_repair_plan`,
`invert_plan`, `Move` / `Action.moved`, and `Guard` at two scopes. This is TUI
work against a settled surface, plus the CLI form ADR 0008 now makes non-negotiable
in the same session.

Do, test-first:

- **A repair key on the selected node.** Drifted earns RENAME, Misplaced
  RELOCATE, Loose SWEEP. Unfiled earns nothing but reveal - it is the one state
  Atlas can never fix. Mapped earns nothing. One key, not four: the node's Filing
  State already decides which Action `build_repair_plan` slices out, so the key
  means "repair this" and the model picks the kind. A key that does nothing on the
  selected node must say so rather than being silently inert - ADR 0007's
  correction bites here, because **only control-plane Expectations are
  repairable** and conform has never created a mapped section.
- **The inline confirm.** ADR 0006: confirmation weight follows plan size. A
  one-Action Plan confirms **on the operation line**, not in a modal. Longer plans
  keep the modal that exists. The operation line is `#operation` and already has
  `-warning` and `-error` variants; a confirm is a third state, and it has to be
  legible in both Compositions and at 46 columns.
- **The scoped guard on apply.** Never `scan_drive`. `Guard.for_action` re-reads
  the map and re-enumerates the two folders the Action touches - 4.24 seconds
  becomes two enumerations. A stale guard refuses and says why.
- **The undo stack.** One per Project, in memory, no redo. Undo pops, inverts via
  `invert_plan`, and runs **the same scoped guard** on the way back - that is what
  lets the stack be optimistic rather than eagerly invalidated. `invert_plan`
  refuses a Plan holding a Backfill, a file-empty removal, or a Conflict; the key
  must present that refusal, not swallow it. Undo restores the precondition that
  offered the repair, so re-pressing the repair key **is** redo.
- **Reconcile after the write.** ADR 0007: forget the folders the Move Manifest
  names, take the fresh report, move the cursor to where the node went. Already
  decided; this is where it gets exercised for the first time.
- **Path length warns and obeys.** `build_plan` computes it; the confirm surfaces
  it; `long_path()` is never applied on the write side. A warning is only honest
  if Atlas cannot silently exceed 260.

## The CLI form this ticket owes

ADR 0008: a capability that writes owes a CLI form, discharged in the same session,
either order. `conform --project NAME --apply --only KIND` already exists and
covers the four action kinds. Two things are missing and both are this ticket's:

- **`conform --node PATH`** - target one node by Node Key rather than filtering by
  action class. `--only` filters by kind, which cannot express "this folder".
- **Undo.** Shape is open: `conform --undo` against a persisted manifest, or
  `--json` emitting the Move Manifest so a caller can invert it themselves. The
  TUI stack is in-memory and per-session; the CLI has no session, so this is a
  real design question and not a transcription. **Settle it before building it.**

## Why it is worth doing

It is the last thing between the tree and the map's destination sentence - "every
write still crossing an `atlas.core` plan with preview and confirmation". Every
piece it needs is built and tested. And it is the ticket that finally exercises
`invert_plan`, `Guard.for_action` and reconcile-by-manifest against a real widget
rather than against fixtures.

## Constraints

- ADR 0006 is the contract. Deviating from it is a decision and goes back on
  ticket 04.
- ADR 0008 is the parity rule. The CLI form ships this session.
- ADR 0007's correction stands: only control-plane Expectations are repairable.
- Fixture drives only. Never the studio drive.
- Colour from `tui/tokens.py`; the app CSS block is geometry only. The confirm
  state on the operation line is a token, not a hex.
- The confirm must read at 46 columns, and colour may not be the only thing
  distinguishing it from `-warning` and `-error` (ADR 0008).

## Resolution

Status: resolved
Date: 2026-09-05
Corrections recorded on `docs/adr/0006` and `docs/adr/0007`

Built test-first through `/tdd`. **405 tests, up from 364.** Repo lint green.
Rendered headless at 120 / 87 / 46 columns and driven end to end with keys only.

### What shipped

- **`tui/repair.py`**, pure like `tui/layout.py`. `repair_offer` decides whether
  the key does anything and carries a reason when it does not - Unfiled says only
  a person can decide, Mapped says it is filed correctly, a non-control-plane
  Expectation says Atlas does not create it (ADR 0007's correction). `confirms_inline`
  and `confirm_line` are ADR 0006's confirmation weight. `UndoStack` is per
  Project, no redo, and **refuses an uninvertible Plan at push rather than at
  pop** - a stack that discovers it cannot honour a depth it advertised is worse
  than one that never advertised it.
- **The key on the node.** `f` means "conform what has focus": the whole project
  from the list, one node from the tree. Arms an inline confirm on the operation
  line; Enter commits, Escape abandons, nothing touches disk until Enter.
- **`u` undoes**, guarded, per Project.
- **`conform --node PATH`** and **`conform --revert FILE`**, the CLI forms ADR
  0008 obliges. `--revert` reads back the `--json` manifest a prior apply printed,
  which needed `plan_from_dict` in core - `action_to_dict` had no inverse, so the
  Move Manifest was write-only.

### Five bugs, and where each came from

Two were design errors in shipped ADRs. Three were shipped code that no test could
have caught, all found by rendering.

1. **`Guard.for_action` cannot guard an undo.** It re-derives the Plan from the
   map and compares; an undo's Plan reverses the map. It refused every undo on a
   drive nothing had changed on. ADR 0006 claimed one guard served both.
   `Guard.for_undo` keeps the map check and the snapshot, drops the re-derivation.
2. **`reconcile` missed the folder a merge consumed.** Every Move in a merge names
   a *child*, so their parents are the two merged folders - never the folder that
   lost the source from its own listing. The tree drew a row for a directory that
   no longer existed, as Mapped. `follow` already knew this and said so in a
   comment; `reconcile` did not.
3. **The Tree Region could not take keyboard focus at all.** `#tree` is a
   `Vertical`; `Vertical.focus()` is a no-op. The app believed it had drilled
   while the arrow keys still drove the project list. **The tree widget shipped
   entirely unreachable by keyboard** and sixteen widget tests plus a console
   shell suite all passed.
4. **Textual's `Tree` took Atlas's Enter** the moment the tree could hold focus.
   `priority=True`, as `tab` already was.
5. **A freshly drilled tree had no cursor.** `cursor_line` is -1 until an arrow
   key moves it, so the repair key was silently inert on arrival.

3, 4 and 5 are one finding wearing three hats: nothing had ever asserted which
widget the keyboard was talking to. Tests asserted on `_focus_region` and on
`display`, and both were correct the whole time.

### Also fixed

`confirm_line` was handed the terminal width, but `#operation` has `padding: 0 2`,
so `Esc cancel` clipped to `Esc` at 46 columns. `OPERATION_MARGIN = 4`, the same
correction ticket 17 needed for the wordmark and named `MARGIN` there. Third time
this repo has paid for that arithmetic.
