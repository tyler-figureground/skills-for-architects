# /zoning-analysis-nyc — Zoning Envelope Analysis (New York City)

Analyze building envelope rules for any lot in New York City using the PLUTO database (NYC Open Data) and the NYC Zoning Resolution.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Input

Accept one of the following identifiers:
- **Address + Borough/Zip** — e.g., "123 Main St, Brooklyn 11201"
- **BBL** — 10-digit Borough-Block-Lot (e.g., 3012340056 = Brooklyn, Block 1234, Lot 56)
- **BIN** — Building Identification Number

Normalize to BBL format: `[borough 1 digit][block 5 digits][lot 4 digits]`

Borough codes:
| Code | Borough |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Manhattan |
| 2 | Bronx |
| 3 | Brooklyn |
| 4 | Queens |
| 5 | Staten Island |

### Step 2: Query PLUTO

Fetch lot data from the NYC PLUTO dataset via the Socrata Open Data API.

**Endpoint:** `https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/64uk-42ks.json`

**Query by BBL:**
```
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/64uk-42ks.json?bbl=XXXXXXXXXX
```

**Query by address (fallback):**
```
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/64uk-42ks.json?$where=address='123 MAIN STREET' AND zipcode='10001'
```

No authentication required for basic queries.

Read `zoning-rules/pluto-fields.md` for the full field reference.

**Extract these key fields:**
- `bbl` — Borough-Block-Lot
- `address`, `zipcode` — street address
- `zonedist1` through `zonedist4` — zoning district(s)
- `overlay1`, `overlay2` — commercial overlay districts
- `spdist1`, `spdist2`, `spdist3` — special purpose districts
- `ltdheight` — limited height district
- `splitzone` — Y if lot is split across zones
- `lotarea` — lot area in SF
- `bldgarea` — total building area in SF
- `builtfar` — as-built FAR
- `residfar` — maximum residential FAR
- `commfar` — maximum commercial FAR
- `facilfar` — maximum community facility FAR
- `numfloors` — existing number of floors
- `landuse` — current land use category
- `zonemap` — zoning map number
- `landmark` — landmark designation
- `histdist` — historic district name
- `borocode`, `block`, `lot` — parsed BBL components

If the query returns no results, inform the user and ask them to verify the address or BBL.

### Step 3: Identify Zoning District

Map the `zonedist1` value to its district type:

| Prefix | Type | Normativa File |
|--------|------|----------------|
| R | Residential | `zoning-rules/residential.md` |
| C | Commercial | `zoning-rules/commercial.md` |
| M | Manufacturing | `zoning-rules/manufacturing.md` |

Check for:
- **Split zones** (`splitzone = Y`): Analyze each `zonedist1`–`zonedist4` separately. Pro-rate FAR by estimated area in each zone if lot dimensions are available, otherwise present both sets of controls.
- **Contextual suffixes** (A, B, D, X): If the district code ends in a letter suffix (e.g., R7A, C6-2A), also load `zoning-rules/contextual-districts.md`.
- **Commercial overlays** (`overlay1`/`overlay2`): If present (e.g., C1-4, C2-5), load `zoning-rules/commercial.md` for overlay rules.
- **Special districts** (`spdist1`–`spdist3`): If present, load `zoning-rules/special-districts.md`.
- **Limited height** (`ltdheight`): Note the height cap.

State your district identification and reasoning clearly.

### Step 4: Load Normativa

Read the relevant regulation files from the skill's `zoning-rules/` directory:

1. **Always read:** `zoning-rules/overview.md` — system primer
2. **Primary district file:** One of `residential.md`, `commercial.md`, or `manufacturing.md`
3. **Conditionally read:**
   - `zoning-rules/contextual-districts.md` — if district has A/B/D/X suffix
   - `zoning-rules/special-districts.md` — if `spdist1`–`spdist3` are populated
   - `zoning-rules/use-groups.md` — for permitted use analysis
   - `zoning-rules/parking.md` — for parking requirements
   - `zoning-rules/city-of-yes.md` — for recent reform impacts

### Step 5: Determine Bulk Controls

Calculate the building envelope for the lot:

1. **Floor Area Ratio (FAR):**
   - Residential FAR (from `residfar` or district table)
   - Commercial FAR (from `commfar` or district table)
   - Community Facility FAR (from `facilfar` or district table)
   - Maximum zoning floor area = FAR × lot area

2. **Building Height:**
   - Base height range (contextual districts)
   - Maximum building height
   - Sky exposure plane angle and setback distance
   - Limited height district cap (if applicable)

3. **Setbacks:**
   - Front: initial setback distance and sky exposure plane
   - Side: narrow/wide street rules
   - Rear: standard 30 ft for residential, varies for commercial
   - Sky exposure plane: ratio and starting height

4. **Lot Coverage:**
   - Maximum lot coverage percentage
   - Open space ratio (for non-contextual R districts)

5. **Yards:**
   - Front yard requirements
   - Side yard requirements (corner lots, through lots)
   - Rear yard: typically 30 ft or 20% of lot depth

Apply contextual district rules when suffix is present — these override standard height/setback rules with mandatory streetwall, base height, and setback requirements.

### Step 6: Check Overlays & Special Districts

Layer additional regulations on top of base district controls:

1. **Commercial overlays** (C1-1 through C2-5 in residential districts):
   - Additional commercial FAR (typically 1.0 or 2.0)
   - Commercial use depth limit (typically 150 ft from street)
   - Permitted commercial uses (Use Groups 5–9 for C1, 5–14 for C2)

2. **Special purpose districts:**
   - Modified bulk controls, use restrictions, design requirements
   - Check `zoning-rules/special-districts.md` for the specific district

3. **Inclusionary Housing:**
   - Bonus FAR available in designated areas
   - Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) areas: must provide affordable units for bonus

4. **Landmark / Historic District:**
   - If `landmark` or `histdist` is populated, note that Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) review is required
   - Bulk controls still apply but modifications may need LPC approval

5. **City of Yes reforms:**
   - Check `zoning-rules/city-of-yes.md` for applicable changes
   - Universal Affordability Preference (UAP): +20% FAR for affordable housing
   - Town Center Zoning: ground-floor commercial in residential districts near transit
   - Parking: most mandates eliminated citywide

### Step 7: Present Analysis

Use the output format below to present a structured, comprehensive analysis.

### Step 8: Save Report

Write the analysis to a markdown file in the current working directory:
- Filename: `zoning-analysis-[address-slug].md`
- Example: `zoning-analysis-123-main-st-brooklyn.md`

## Buildable Envelope

### Plan View
ASCII diagram showing the lot boundary with setbacks and buildable zone. Orient with the primary street frontage at the bottom. Label dimensions, setback distances, and buildable area. Use PLUTO lot dimensions (lotfront, lotdepth) where available.

Example:
```
                    ← 170 ft →
         ┌────────────────────────────┐
         │        20 ft rear yard     │  ↑
         │  ┌──────────────────────┐  │  |
         │  │                      │  │  |
         │  │   BUILDABLE ZONE     │  │  130 ft
         │  │   ~150 ft × 170 ft   │  │  |
         │  │                      │  │  |
         │  │                      │  │  |
         │  └──────────────────────┘  │  ↓
         └────────────────────────────┘
              HUDSON ST (wide street)
              ← no front setback →
```

### Section View
ASCII cross-section showing the height and setback envelope from street level. Include base height, setback, sky exposure plane, and maximum height. For contextual districts, show the mandatory streetwall height range.

Example:
```
  290 ft ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ max height
         │              ╱
         │            ╱  sky exposure
         │          ╱    plane (5.6:1)
         │        ╱
   85 ft ├──────┤ ← setback line
         │      │
         │      │ base / streetwall
         │      │ (60–85 ft)
         │      │
  ───────┴──────┴──────────────── street
         HUDSON ST (wide)
```

Adapt both diagrams to the specific lot. Use actual dimensions and controls from the analysis. If the lot is irregular or split-zone, note the complexity and simplify where needed.

## Caveats
- This analysis is based on publicly available zoning data (PLUTO) and general Zoning Resolution rules
- Always verify with NYC Department of City Planning and ZoLa (zola.planning.nyc.gov)
- Special permits, variances, and BSA actions are not reflected in PLUTO data
- City of Yes provisions are being phased in — confirm effective dates for specific provisions
- Site-specific conditions (flood zones, coastal erosion, environmental restrictions) require additional review
- This is not a substitute for professional zoning analysis or legal advice
```

## Notes

- The NYC Zoning Resolution is maintained by the Department of City Planning
- PLUTO data is updated quarterly — verify currency for critical decisions
- Contextual districts (with letter suffixes) have mandatory streetwall and height rules that override standard bulk controls
- City of Yes for Housing Opportunity was adopted December 2024 — some provisions phase in over time
- When in doubt about district classification or applicable rules, always ask the user
- For split-zone lots, analyze each zone separately and note the complexity
- ZoLa (zola.planning.nyc.gov) is the authoritative visual reference — recommend users verify there
